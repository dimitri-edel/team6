      <h2>Honoring the Pioneers Who Helped Shape Our Digital World</h2>

      <p>Technology as we know it today exists because of the brilliant minds who dared to innovate, break barriers, and push boundaries. Among these pioneers are extraordinary women in techâ€”mathematicians, engineers, programmers, and visionariesâ€”who have shaped the world through their expertise and dedication.</p>

      <p>At <strong>Rippley</strong>, we believe their stories should be known, their contributions celebrated, and their legacies carried forward. Our Foreâ€™Womenâ€”from <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong>, the first computer programmer, to <strong>Radia Perlman</strong>, the architect of modern networkingâ€”have paved the way for innovation.</p>

      <p>Their impact extends across generations, from the codebreakers of World War II to todayâ€™s leaders in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and digital technology. They have built the foundations of computing, launched us to the moon, secured our digital networks, and continue to redefine what is possible.</p>

      <p>Many of these trailblazing women overcame immense challengesâ€”facing gender discrimination, lack of recognition, and barriers to education. Yet, their brilliance and persistence ensured that their work not only endured but thrived, influencing every aspect of the tech-driven world we live in today.</p>
